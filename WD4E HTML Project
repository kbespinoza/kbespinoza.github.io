        <h1>My Top 3 Favorite Japanese Foods</h1>
        <p><strong>When most people think about Japanese food, they’ll say “Sushi!” However, for me, I think there are lots of other foods that are just as delicious. The following are 3 of those favorites and a few points why I think they’re great.</strong></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>#1 Nabe</h2>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Botan_nabe_%28boar_stew%29_%2845286025284%29.jpg" alt="nabe hot pot" width="400">
            <p>It is a hot pot with various vegetables & meats simmered in soup stock. It is a quintessential fall/winter comfort food. Why is it great?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It's simple – hop the vegetables, meats, tofu, and konyaku noodles and put in your favorite soup stock! Let all the flavors boil and come together and enjoy!</li>
                <li>It’s fast – after a few minutes some ingredients cook quickly, and you can serve your bowl while other items are still cooking.</li>
                <li>Healthy – it has tons of nutrients and very filing. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>#2 Yakitori</h2>
            <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/17692192/pexels-photo-17692192/free-photo-of-stir-fired-meat-on-stick.png" alt="yakitori" width="380">
            <p>Most well-known izakaya (Japanese bar) food. It is grilled chicken skewers made from small pieces of chicken such as breast, innards, thigh, liver, skin, and cartilage – and, seasoned with salt or special yakitori sauce. Why is it amazing?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Best drinking companion – goes well with any kind of alcohol, but best is beer.</li>
                <li>Easy to eat right off the stick.</li>
                <li>Excellent for sharing with friends as well.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>#3 Natto</h2>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Natto_mixed_by_Kinchan1.jpg/500px-Natto_mixed_by_Kinchan1.jpg" alt="natto" width="400">
            <ul>
                <li>It is rich in vitamins, nutrients, and fiber making it a great food for heart, gut, and bone health.</li>
                <li>There are many ways to serve it – you can add sauces, green onions, okra, a raw egg – my personal favorite is plum sauce.</li>
                <li>If you mix it up 100 times in circular motion, you will get a creamy texture making it extra delicious.</li>
            </ul>
